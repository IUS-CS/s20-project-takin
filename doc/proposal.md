# Proposal 
We proposed to make an online order web application using the .NET CORE framework. This application will solve the problem of having to wait in line to order food. Our application will be hassle-free, meaning customers customer will not have to go to the restaurant's website and search around for the menu and go back and order. They can just visit our website to do everything they need to place an order, all in one place. 

Once the customer places an order notification will be sent to the restaurant about the order detail. For our project, we will only add the Indiana University Southeast Cafeteria menu. However, it will be scaleable and can add other restaurants in the future.
